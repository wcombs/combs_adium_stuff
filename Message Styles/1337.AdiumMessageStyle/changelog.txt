Version 0.1.4: Mon Dec 15 2008
------------------------------
  - Oh well, I'll never be able to properly align things as I'd like to!
    I decided to use another (monospaced) font and all of a sudden, the 
    "aligning gap" was way too wide... So here comes the "narrow" variations... 
    Hopefully, with three different widths, you'll be able to have one to match 
    your needs...
    
    Also, be aware that these "narrow" variations work for me and my particular
    font (Fixed6x13, taken out of the Unix world) but they will look horrible 
    with other, more standard, fonts.

Version 0.1.3: Tue Jun 12 2007
------------------------------
  - Fixed chat alignment at the bottom of the chat window when used with
    the last version of WebKit (coming with Safari 3 beta). Hopefully that
    won't break things with earlier version...

Version 0.1.2: Tue Apr 3 2007
-----------------------------
  - Fixed layout bug due to field overflow when 12-hour clock format was used.
    Thus introduced "Wide" style variants.

Version 0.1.1: Wed Mar 28 2007
------------------------------
  - Fixed to allow custom (transparent) background.
  
Version 0.1.0: Mon Mar 26 2007
------------------------------
  - Initial version.
